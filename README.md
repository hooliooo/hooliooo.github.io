# About

Hi, my name is Julio Alorro and I have been a professional software developer since 2017. My expertise mostly revolves around iOS development but lately I have been using Kotlin and Spring Boot professionally.

My [github profile](https://github.com/hooliooo) contains mostly hobby projects and libraries I created as learning exercises. My favorite language is Swift

# Favorite OSS Projects

* [CodeBuilder](https://github.com/hooliooo/CodeBuilder) - A tiny Swift library that leverages function builders to create Swift code
